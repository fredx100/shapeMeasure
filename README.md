# shapeMeasure #

With a pedastal, protractor, and laser rangefinder a user can gather vectors (distance, angle pairs) from an arbitrary origin which will describe a 2D area. This project aims to automate the transformation of that data into a graphical representation.

## Motivation ##

I want to add shelves/bespoke CNC'd desks to irregular corners of various rooms. As such, I need to be able to, reletively accurately, measure 2D slices of a room.

Currently this is a placeholder project. The main content is yet to be written. :(
